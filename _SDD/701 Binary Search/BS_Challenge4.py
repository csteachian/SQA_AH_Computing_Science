# CHALLENGE 4
# -----------
# Test your program by searching for items that are:
# Near the start (left) of the list
# Near the end (right) of the list
# In the middle of the list
# In the first Â¼ (approx.) of the list
# Make a note of the amount of comparisons being performed in the above searches.
# What is the worst-case and best-case results with regard to position and the amount of comparisons being performed?

# Best Case position  |   3     |   Amount of comparisons   |   1
# Worst Case position | 0,2,4,6 |   Amount of comparisons   |   3
